Have a look at this implementation of map() and filter(), can you spot what's wrong with this code? Select all the errors you can find.

const strings = ["David", "Richard", "Karen", "Amanda", 7];

const resultStrings = strings
  .map((string) => string.length)
  .filter(string.length < 6);

- 7 cannot be mapped to a length
- filter() should usually be called first
- filter() should take in a callback function
