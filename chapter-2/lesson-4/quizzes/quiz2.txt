What is true about the useEffect hook? Select all that apply.

- useEffect allows us to access lifecycle events in functional components
- Passing in an array as the second argument in useEffect() indicates that we just want the effect run once
  (i.e., only during mount and unmount)
- Leveraging the useEffect hook is a great way to fetch data to display in a component, or run some special
  function/logic when a component mounts.
